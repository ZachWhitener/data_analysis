"\1\Data for 1986-87 and later years reflect a basis of 20 meals per week rather than meals 7 days per week. Because of this revision in data collection and tabulation procedures, data are not entirely comparable with figures for previous years. In particular, data on board rates are somewhat higher than earlier years because they reflect the basis of 20 meals per week rather than meals served 7 days per week. Since many institutions serve fewer than 3 meals each day, the 1986-87 and later data reflect a more accurate accounting of total board costs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\2\Room and board data are estimated.    ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\3\Data have been revised from previously published figures.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
\4\Preliminary data based on fall 2005 enrollment weights.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Data are for the entire academic year and are average total charges for full-time attendance. Tuition and fees were weighted by the number of full-time-equivalent undergraduates, but were not adjusted to reflect student residency. Room and board were based on full-time students. The data have not been adjusted for changes in the purchasing power of the dollar over time. Data through 1995-96 are for institutions of higher education, while later data are for degree-granting institutions. Degree-granting institutions grant associate’s or higher degrees and participate in Title IV federal financial aid programs. The degree-granting classification is very similar to the earlier higher education classification, but it includes more 2-year colleges and excludes a few higher education institutions that did not grant degrees. (See Guide to Sources for details.) Because of their low response rate, data for private 2-year colleges must be interpreted with caution. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
